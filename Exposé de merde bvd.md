In summary, we have shown that MeSA and jasmonate signaling are essential for systemic resistance in N. benthamiana. We also showed that JA and MeJA signaling likely regulate MeSA and SA production in N. benthamiana plants. Thus, our studies revealed a new mechanism for the interaction between JA and SA in mediating systemic resistance response and provide a framework to further understand the molecular mechanisms of plant defense against virus pathogens.

We previously showed that endogenous ABA concentration was increased 2 to 6-fold in dark-green areas of TMV-infected leaf and that treatment with exogenous ABA in physiological amounts also increased chlorophyll concentration and reduced susceptibility to infection.

Some of the ABA is transported to upper leaves where it induces a dark-green, antiviral state in cells bordering the veins. This state may be induced by ABA itself or occur through the effect of ABA on cytokinin metabolism.

Growth inhibition is another prominent symptom of virus infection where altered cytokinin metabolism may be important.

It is possible, therefore, that the observed virus-induced reduction in free Z concentration may decrease cell division and hence contribute to the reduced growth of infected leaves.

We identified and cloned from *N. tabacum* Xanthi nn plants **a full-length, novel gene (NH), homologous to the N gene**
cDNA of NH and H 82,8% nucleotide identity shared.

NH protein belongs to TIR/NBS/LRR resistance gene class

Plant disease resulting from virus infection is thought to be caused by metabolic changes in particular sets of plant cells during the establishment and replication of the virus.

The intactness of chloroplasts was examined according to Lilley et al. by the ferricyanide reduction method and by phase contrast microscopy.

The analysis of photosynthetic rates in infected leaves revealed that electron flow through PSII was greatly reduced in chloroplasts containing large levels of TMV-CP, i.e. those isolated from TMV-PV230 infections.

We suggest instead that PSII activity may be inhibited by the large accumulation of CP of TMV-PV230 in both stroma and in thylakoid membranes, a phenomenon not detected in symptomless infected leaves.

Cytokinin (CTK)-mediated pathways play essential roles in plant stress responses. How CTK receptors affect plant resistance to viral pathogens remains unclear.
Nicotiana tabacum CRE1 (CTK receptor 1) in modulating virus susceptibility in N. tabacum. CRE1 deficiency enhanced thesusceptibility of N. tabacum to TMV-GFP.

The generation of ROS is one of the hallmarks of plant responses against pathogens.

In the present study, the deficiency of CRE1 in N. tabacum resulted in a strong increase in the susceptibility of N. tabacum to TMV (Fig. 1). Foliar application of exogenous 6-BA (a kind of CTK) failed to completely decrease the susceptibility of tobacco to TMV caused by CRE1 deficiency but was still effective in reducing the susceptibility in the RNAi plants (Fig. 7), confirming that CTKs and CRE1have a positive role in the defence response of N. tabacumagainst TMV-GFP.
Our studyindicated that the endogenous levels of SA and the transcript levels of NPR1 in tobacco induced by TMVGFP were significantly depressed in the RNAi plants compared to the WT plants, and SA-mediated defence genes, including PR1 and PR5, were also significantly suppressed in the RNAi plants after virus inoculation,
These results suggested that the deficiency of CRE1 in N. tabacum may negatively modulate the SA signalling system to increase the disease susceptibility of N. tabacum to TMV-GFP.

Overall, the results presented here indicated thatN. tabacum cre1 RNAi mutants are more vulnerable to TMV-GFP infection than WT plants. Our collective evidence suggests that CRE1 is a positive regulator of N. tabacum against TMV-GFP and demonstrates that
complete CTK signalling is required for the induction and development of defence responses in N. tabacum induced by TMV-GFP.

La superoxyde dismutase (SOD) **est une enzyme produite par les cellules des organismes vivants, animaux et végétaux**. Sa fonction est de piéger les radicaux libres produits par le métabolisme. La superoxyde dismutase est un antioxydant puissant.
ROS = méca de défense mais autotoxique et SOD = régulation des ROS
