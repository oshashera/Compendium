In summary, we have shown that MeSA and jasmonate signaling are essential for systemic resistance in N. benthamiana. We also showed that JA and MeJA signaling likely regulate MeSA and SA production in N. benthamiana plants. Thus, our studies revealed a new mechanism for the interaction between JA and SA in mediating systemic resistance response and provide a framework to further understand the molecular mechanisms of plant defense against virus pathogens.

We previously showed that endogenous ABA concentration was increased 2 to 6-fold in dark-green areas of TMV-infected leaf and that treatment with exogenous ABA in physiological amounts also increased chlorophyll concentration and reduced susceptibility to infection.

Some of the ABA is transported to upper leaves where it induces a dark-green, antiviral state in cells bordering the veins. This state may be induced by ABA itself or occur through the effect of ABA on cytokinin metabolism.

Growth inhibition is another prominent symptom of virus infection where altered cytokinin metabolism may be important.

It is possible, therefore, that the observed virus-induced reduction in free Z concentration may decrease cell division and hence contribute to the reduced growth of infected leaves.

We identified and cloned from *N. tabacum* Xanthi nn plants **a full-length, novel gene (NH), homologous to the N gene**
cDNA of NH and H 82,8% nucleotide identity shared.

NH protein belongs to TIR/NBS/LRR resistance gene class
*N gene... Stange; TomÃ¡s; Elorza; Arce-Johnson 2004*



Plant disease resulting from virus infection is thought to be caused by metabolic changes in particular sets of plant cells during the establishment and replication of the virus.

The intactness of chloroplasts was examined according to Lilley et al. by the ferricyanide reduction method and by phase contrast microscopy.

The analysis of photosynthetic rates in infected leaves revealed that electron flow through PSII was greatly reduced in chloroplasts containing large levels of TMV-CP, i.e. those isolated from TMV-PV230 infections.

We suggest instead that PSII activity may be inhibited by the large accumulation of CP of TMV-PV230 in both stroma and in thylakoid membranes, a phenomenon not detected in symptomless infected leaves.
