In summary, we have shown that MeSA and jasmonate signaling are essential for systemic resistance in N. benthamiana. We also showed that JA and MeJA signaling likely regulate MeSA and SA production in N. benthamiana plants. Thus, our studies revealed a new mechanism for the interaction between JA and SA in mediating systemic resistance response and provide a framework to further understand the molecular mechanisms of plant defense against virus pathogens.

We previously showed that endogenous ABA concentration was increased 2 to 6-fold in dark-green areas of TMV-infected leaf and that treatment with exogenous ABA in physiological amounts also increased chlorophyll concentration and reduced susceptibility to infection.

Some of the ABA is transported to upper leaves where it induces a dark-green, antiviral state in cells bordering the veins. This state may be induced by ABA itself or occur through the effect of ABA on cytokinin metabolism.

Growth inhibition is another prominent symptom of virus infection where altered cytokinin metabolism may be important.

It is possible, therefore, that the observed virus-induced reduction in free Z concentration may decrease cell division and hence contribute to the reduced growth of infected leaves.
